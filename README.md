## 📖 About

**NOTE:** This is a fork and modernization of the original `node-red-contrib-opcua-server` by Klaus Landsdorf, which has not been maintained for over 2 years. This updated version was created by Richard Meyer to work with the latest versions of node-opcua and its dependencies, while fixing broken/incomplete features from the original project.

### Key Improvements Over Original

- ✅ **Loading of nodeset XML files** from inside the node configuration
- ✅ **Full OPC UA security policy support** with modern implementations
- ✅ **TypeScript support** for better development experience
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite** ensuring reliability
- ✅ **Latest dependencies** with active maintenance

## 🔒 Security Enhancements

### Critical Vulnerability Fixes

This version eliminates critical security vulnerabilities present in the original package:

- **CVE-2023-29017** & **CVE-2023-30547**: Replaced vulnerable vm2 library with secure direct execution
- **Enhanced Security**: Prototype pollution protection and input validation
- **Secure Script Execution**: Timeout limits and enhanced error handling
- **Modern Security Practices**: Following Node.js security best practices

## 🏗️ Core Technology

- **Direct Execution**: Secure script execution replacing vulnerable vm2
- **node-opcua 2.154.0**: Stable generation OPC UA library from [Etienne Rossignon](https://github.com/erossignon/)
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and enhanced development experience
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 61 tests covering all functionality

## 📦 Installation

Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`:

```bash
npm install @xlabnpm/node-red-contrib-opcua-xlabserver
```

### Build from Source (if needed)

If you encounter installation issues, try these options:

```bash
npm install @xlabnpm/node-red-contrib-opcua-xlabserver --unsafe-perm --build-from-source
```

## 🚀 Quick Getting Started

### Basic Setup

1. **Add the OPC UA Server node** to your Node-RED flow
2. **Configure the endpoint**: Set the endpoint URL (default: `opc.tcp://localhost:54840`)
3. **Deploy your flow**: The server will start automatically

### Default Configuration

A detailed example server is included with pre-populated address space nodes deployed in various formats. If you use the default port `54840`, simply define the endpoint URL in the format:

```
opc.tcp://<node-red-ip>:54840
```

### Testing Your Server

We recommend [Prosys OPC UA Browser](https://prosysopc.com/products/opc-ua-browser/) for testing:

1. **Install an OPC UA client** (Prosys is free with email registration)
2. **Connect to your endpoint** using the URL above
3. **Set security to "None"** for initial testing (anonymous login)
4. **Browse the Objects folder** to see your data

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Loading Nodeset XML Files

Navigate to the **Users & Sets** tab and enter the **absolute path** to your nodeset XML file.

**Pre-included Nodesets:**
This package includes nodesets in `src/public/nodesets/`. Example path:
```
/root/.node-red/node_modules/@xlabnpm/node-red-contrib-opcua-xlabserver/src/public/nodesets/Opc.Ua.AutoID.NodeSet2.xml
```

**Validation:**
Successfully loaded nodesets appear in **Types → DataTypes → XML Schema** in your OPC UA client.

### TypeScript Development

For developers working with TypeScript:

```bash
# Development build with source maps
npm run build:dev

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch

# Production build
npm run build:ts
```

### Security Configuration

- **Anonymous Access**: Enabled by default for easy setup
- **User Authentication**: Configure in the Users & Sets tab
- **Certificate Security**: Specify certificate paths for secure connections
- **Security Policies**: Support for modern OPC UA security standards

## 📋 Examples

Example projects are provided in the `examples` folder:

- **[example-server.json](https://github.com/Hisma/@xlabnpm/node-red-contrib-opcua-xlabserver/tree/master/examples/example-server.json)**: Basic server configuration
- **[example-with-context.json](https://github.com/Hisma/@xlabnpm/node-red-contrib-opcua-xlabserver/tree/master/examples/example-with-context.json)**: Dynamic data from flow context

Simply copy the JSON and import into your Node-RED flows.

## 🐛 Debug & Troubleshooting

### Verbose Logging

Enable debug logging for detailed information:

```bash
DEBUG=opcuaCompact* node-red -v 1>Node-RED-OPC-UA-Server.log 2>&1
```

### Common Issues

- **"Cannot read properties of null"**: Check nodeset file path is correct
- **Connection refused**: Verify endpoint URL and port availability
- **Security errors**: Ensure security settings match between client and server
